RSDic
=====

rsdic is a Go package for rank/select dictionary supporting rank/select operations efficiently,
and space efficient for both sparse and dense bit arrays.
(Such data structures are also called as fully indexable dictionary in CS literatures (FID)).

Conceptually, rsdic represents a bit vector B[0...num), B[i] = 0 or 1,
and bits are provided PushBack operation (Thus RSDic supports dynamic addition).

All operations (Bit, Rank, Select, BitAndRank, RunZeros) are supported in O(1) time.
For example, rsdic can solve all above operation within 1 micro second for a bit vector of length 10^8 (100M bit).

RSDic combines the idea of on-the-fly decoding of enumrative code,
and utilization of rank/select samplings, which is discussed as a future work in the paper [1].

In RSDic, a bit vector is stored in compressed form (Note, we don't need to decode all at operations).
To achieve this, a bit vector is divided into small blocks of length 64, and each small block
is compressed using enumurative code. For example, a small block contains 10 ones
and 54 zeros will be compressed in 38 bits (See enumCode.go for detail).
This achieves not only its information theoretic bound, but also achieves more compression
if bits are clusterd.
rsdic stores information at most 1.3 bit per original bit including its indicies, and compress more if bit vector
is "compressible".

This Go version is based on the C++ implementation [2].
But this Go version supports PushBack so that it can support dynamic addition.

Usage (details are in `./sample`)
=====

	import "github.com/hillbig/rsdic"

	rsd := rsdic.New()
	rsd.PushBack(true)
	rsd.PushBack(false)
	rsd.PushBack(true)
	rsd.PushBack(true)
	// rsd = 1011
	fmt.Printf("%d %d %d\n", rsd.Num(), rsd.OneNum(), rsd.ZeroNum()) // 4 3 1

	// Bit(pos uint64) returns B[pos]
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", rsd.Bit(2)) // true

	// Rank(pos uint64, bit bool) returns the number of bit's in B[0...pos)
	fmt.Printf("%d %d\n", rsd.Rank(2, false), rsd.Rank(4, true)) // 1 3

	// Select(rank uint64, bit bool) returns the position of (rank+1)-th occurence of bit in B.
	oneNum := rsd.OneNum()
	for i := uint64(0); i < oneNum; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%d:%d\n", i, rsd.Select(i, true))
	}
	// 0:0
	// 1:2
	// 2:3

	rsd.PushBack(false) // You can add anytime

	// Use MarshalBinary() and UnmarshalBinary() for serialize/deserialize RSDic.
	bytes, _ := rsd.MarshalBinary()
	newrsd := rsdic.New()
	_ = newrsd.UnmarshalBinary(bytes)

	// Enjoy !

The results shows that RSDic operations require always
(almost) constant time with regard to the length and one's ratio.
